READ: this repository itself will be treated as a ROS package. It will contain one or more nodes that are intended to be run on the turtlebot itself, and it will contain one or more nodes that will be run on the host PC. The same package will be cloned to both machines for convenience. We will probably create two separate launch files, one that will be run on the robot and one that will be run on the host PC.
